Hi! I'm Paul! I've been doing the computering thing for more of my life than I have not
been doing the computering thing (please send help). While I've enjoyed computering, the
last few years of community computering have been rough (along with rough computering
employers). My goal is to find joy in the community of programmers, primarily by bringing
joy with me.

I hope you find the content helpful and/or positive. If you don't, please feel free to
_pull me in_ by [letting me know](https://twitter.com/rockstar_) it could be more
encouraging/helpful.
