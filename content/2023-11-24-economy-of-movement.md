Title: Economy of movement—Ergonomics of code

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine had a get together that brought together many different friend groups. I was the only member of my designated friend group, which required me to mingle with other groups. I found my kindreds in a corner talking about the heavy parts of their careers, and how experience changes their perspective.

As I spoke about enabling less experienced engineers and helping them set boundaries on their skill set, one of the people I was talking to said “it sounds like you’re talking about economy of motion.”

“I’m not familiar with that term,” I said. “What does that mean?”

“I work as a chef, in a kitchen. When you first start out in a kitchen, the way you’re judged is how you move. Everything is so busy that you have to keep your moving constantly. It’s a mix of staying engaged while conserving your energy. Your shifts are long, and there are lots of veggies to cut.”

Okay, this sounds a lot like early software engineering: you stay at a single station and are given bits of work to do. As you get faster and faster, you’re just given more work, and have to learn to be more efficient doing those tasks.

“Cutting veggies all day, or making soup, you start to think about how you lay out your station so that you can become more efficient. Then people start asking questions about how you’re so quick, and you provide insights. After a while, you start giving input on other station layouts, or how to change the kitchen. You might suggest moving veggie prep over to the other side of the kitchen. As the menu changes over time, you’ll constantly be involved in that.”

Oh, yeah, here we go. More experienced engineers start thinking about processes, and what tools should be used, and what the bigger architecture looks like. As the organization changes, as OKRs change, a more experienced engineer will be able to understand the ramifications of those changes.

I’ve thought a lot about this since then. I’ve read what I can about the Motion Economy. Much of the formal writing is manufacturing-oriented, but it still very much applies. For instance, the floor manager of a manufacturing plant may not know how to do _everything_ that is being done on the floor, but they can help streamline anyone’s processes and work station to get the most from them.

As I’ve explored this idea, I’ve learned another thing about this idea: when a special guest comes to a restaurant and wants to order something off menu, the decision isn’t just about whether the kitchen has the ingredients, but also how much retooling will be required to make the dish. If it would upend the kitchen, the request is often denied.

I have worked in a number of organizations that _might_ make sense in a home kitchen. Knives in the knife drawer, plates in the plate rack, pans in the pan cabinet. Organized, right? But in a professional kitchen, if you needed to walk over to the knife drawer every time you needed a knife, not only would that not be efficient, but carrying a knife through a kitchen always comes with a risk.

In practice, what that means is that in order to make _any_ change, there isn’t a lot of ergonomics: lots of trips to the other side of the proverbial kitchen to get a knife, and if you don’t have a deep understanding of the movements of all the others in the kitchen (or you’re just not 100% focused on them), you could be calling an ambulance.

Put your tools where you use them. Group logic not by what it does, but where it’s used. Constantly adjust what that looks like. If you find that your changes are spanning directories or repositories or companies, it might be time to rethink your “kitchen layout.”
